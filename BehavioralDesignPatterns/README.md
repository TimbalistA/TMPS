Behavioral Design Patterns

Iterator Pattern
--
Iterator Pattern is a relatively simple and frequently used design pattern. There are a lot of data structures/collections available in every language. Each collection must provide an iterator that lets it iterate through its objects. However while doing so it should make sure that it does not expose its implementation.

Memento
--
Memento pattern is used to restore state of an object to a previous state. Memento pattern falls under behavioral pattern category.
Memento pattern uses three actor classes. Memento contains state of an object to be restored. Originator creates and stores states in Memento objects and Caretaker object is responsible to restore object state from Memento.

State
--
The main idea of State pattern is to allow the object for changing its behavior without changing its class. Also, by implementing it, the code should remain cleaner without many if/else statements.

Template
--
Template method design pattern is to define an algorithm as skeleton of operations and leave the details to be implemented by the child classes.
